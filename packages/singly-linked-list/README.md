# Singly Linked List

## Description
Javascript implementation of a [singly linked
list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list) data structure.  Although this
is designed to be used with [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org), this
implementation could be used in other contexts with only minor modifications.

In simple terms, a singly linked list consists of one or more 'nodes'.  Each
node has a data field (which can contain any data--a primative value or complex
object) and a pointer to the next 'node'. This link to the next node is
why this data structure is called a 'linked list'.

Provides the basic functionality of adding nodes to the front or back of the
list, as well as the ability to insert a node at any given position in the
list.  It also provides the ability to remove nodes at the front or back of the
list, or from any given position.

The find, or search, functionality provides the ability to find the first node
containing some specified data. It also provides the ability to find a node
given a specific position, or index, in the list.
