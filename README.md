# Data Structures

> A collection of fundamental data structures implemented in javascript/typescript

This project is a consolidation of mulitple repositories in an effort to simplify code reuse with
the added benefit of minimizing maintenance chores. Along with the consolidation, this project is a
motivation to refactor the orginal javascript implementation to leverage the type safety and
improved tooling of typescript.

Data structures included in the project are:

-   Singly Linked List
