# Data Structures

> A collection of fundamental data structures implemented in javascript/typescript

This project is a consolidation of mulitple repositories in an effort to simplify code reuse with the added benefit of minimizing maintenance chores. Along with the consolidation, this project is a motivation to refactor the orginal javascript implementation to leverage the type safety and improved tooling of typescript. Data structures included in the project are:

-   [Singly Linked List](https://github.com/jasonsjones/data-structures/tree/master/packages/singly-linked-list)
-   [Set](https://github.com/jasonsjones/data-structures/tree/master/packages/set)

_more will be added as the consolidation progresses_
